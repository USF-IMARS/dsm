1.0     Monday, January 10, 2005
        The first release.
1.0.1   Thursday, January 20, 2005
        I added putTimedAncillary. I established a convention that the
        spacecraft name is all uppercase. I changed all methods to ensure this.
1.0.2   Tuesday, January 25, 2005
        I changed Product to remove its own time converter (SimpleDateFormat object)
        and to use the one in Utility instead. Product's version did not account 
        for GMT-0.
1.1.0   Thursday, January 27, 2005
        Added "gov" to the package string so it is now gov.nasa.gsfc.nisgs.dsm.
        DSM.java: Changed reserveProduct signatures so that sleepSeconds is of
        type Integer instead of int per user request.
        Added Product[] getProducts(int passID), Pass[] getPasses()
        Product.java: Added setCenter and setCorners method with Number arguments.
1.1.1   Tuesday, February 08, 2005
        Product.java: Added setAgent(String) and changed the default agent string 
        to "****". The Product(Product) constructor would throw an exception before
        these changes were made.
        DSM.java: Added a getPass() method that does not require a station name.
        Pass.java: Added contains() method.
1.1.2   Wednesday, February 09, 2005
        Product.java: Added productType argument to Product(Product) constructor.
        We split DSMAdministrator.java from DSM.java. DSM.java now only
        contains methods used by the community, and DSMAdministrator has DSM
        agent and administrative methods. DSMAdministrator derives from DSM.
        Utility.java: Made quote() public.
1.2     Wednesday, February 23, 2005
        This version uses a modified set of database tables, and it will not 
        work with the earlier database version. I have added site and directory
        information to the DB. This version keeps track of site and directory
        location for products and ancillary data.
2.0     Monday, March 14, 2005        
        This version uses the 1.2 database with many new methods including
        reserving products by wildcard product types and recognising NISGS
        system properties.
3.0     Tuesday, June 21, 2005
        A major upgrade. Introduces DSMR, which copies files on demand, and
        deletes Ancillaryman. PdsMover no longer sends PDS files to NISDS1.
        Adds TransferCommands table to the database.
3.5     Wednesday, July 13, 2005
        Fixed subtable support and added getAttribute to Product class.
3.10    Made it more robust to errors.
3.14    Added methods to delete resources and ancillaries. Added "addResource()."
3.15    Tuesday, November 29, 2005
        Changed DB tables TLEs to SatTimeAncillaries and TLE_Sites to
        SatTimeAncillarySites, which generalized the table. Added support
        for other spacecraft-time ancillaries such as LUTs.
        Enhanced Caption so that it inserts geolocation into products.
        Use the latest version of the ftp library.
3.16    Thursday, December 01, 2005
        Added delete protection to products, passes, and ancillaries.
        Added directory transfer in DSMR for dem-like ancillaries.
3.18    Wednesday, January 18, 2006
        Added "published" flag to database. Made sleep time in agents a -D parameter.
3.19    Wednesday, January 25, 2006
        Fixed capsule problem. It threw a null pointer exception if it tried to
        create an ancestor Product that was unpublished. I added "published" to
        Resource to distinguish between unpublished and deleted.
        Added a creation date to Pass. Hoover deletes passes by creation date.
3.20    Tuesday, February 07, 2006
        I added a "delete" flag to products and ancillaries in the database.
3.22    2/24/2006
        I fixed a problem in DSM's fetchProduct method in which they would block
        forever if they could not get a product.
3.23    2/24/2006-3/7/06
        KR -- added a check in PdsPassCreate to throw it pass "slivers" below 60 seconds
        KR -- copied from an older DMS directory the subdirs Test and Support that may be
              useful in the future
